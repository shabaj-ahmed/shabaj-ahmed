### Hi, Iâ€™m Shabaj

**About Me** <br />
I'm a recent PhD graduate in Human-Robot Interaction, where my research focused on designing robotic coaches that support long-term behaviour change and healthy habit formation. My background spans the automotive industry, tech startups, and academic research. Across all of these, Iâ€™ve been driven by a simple question: _How can we use technology to solve real-world problems and improve peopleâ€™s lives?_ Iâ€™m naturally curious, adaptable, and always eager to learn something new.

**Skills and Expertise** <br />
**Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge**: Mechanical engineering, embedded systems, electronics and software development <br />
**Team Collaboration**: Self-motivated but happiest when working with multidisciplinary teams. <br />
**Adaptable Learner**: Quick to pick up new tools and methods, with a pragmatic approach to applying them. <br />

**Current Work and Skills** <br />
**Open to new opportunities**: I passed my viva in June 2025 and am actively looking for a role <br />
**Personal projects**: I'm currently building some software tools and experimenting with wearable and robotic tech. Check out my [repositories](https://github.com/shabaj-ahmed?tab=repositories) to see what Iâ€™m working on.

**Professional Highlights** <br />
**PhD Research at Bristol University**: Advancing the field of human-robot interaction. <br />
**Co-founder at 3D Farms**: Led the development of an automated aeroponics warehouse. <br />
**ADAS System Architect at Jaguar Land Rover**: Managed and coordinated autonomous driving signals between ECUs <br />

**Education** <br />
**CDT in Robotics** - Bristol University <br />
**MEng in Mechanical Engineering** - Cardiff University, Graduated with a First class honours<br />

**Key Projects and Achievements** <br />
**Progressable**: A cross-platform exercise journal application developed using Flutter. Download it at www.progressable.co.uk.  
**BrisHacks Hackathon 2024 Winner**: To tackle childhood obesity, we created a video game that requires players to engage in physical activities to control the character on screen. <br />
**Robotic + Care Hackathon 2023 Winner**: Developed a social care robot to aid in healthcare settings. <br />

**Hobbies and Interests** <br />
Outside the PhD, I enjoy a balanced lifestyle with interests ranging from fitness and photography to DIY. <br />

**Looking for Collaborations** <br />
I am open to collaborations involving Human-Robot interaction or health technology, particularly projects aiming to enhance or augment human performance or improve health span. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk through an idea with me or if you have a project that you want help with. <br />
