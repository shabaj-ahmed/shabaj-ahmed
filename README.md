### Hi, I'm Shabaj

## About Me
I am an Embedded Software Engineer at EnseraDesign. My experience spans mechanical design, embedded systems, electronics, and software development. I enjoy building technology that supports people in practical and meaningful ways, especially in the health, well-being, and assistive technology space.

## Skills and Expertise
**Embedded & Robotics Engineering**: ESP32/STM32, FreeRTOS, BLE, sensor integration  
**Software Development**: Python, C/C++, Flutter (Dart), robotics prototyping with ROS 2  
**Systems Thinking**: Multidisciplinary prototyping, systems engineering, systems architecture, UX for human–robot interaction  
**Collaborative R&D**: Experience working across engineering, research, and product teams  
**Mechanical & Electronics Foundations**: Mechanical design, prototyping, PCB basics, system integration

## Current Work and Skills
**Full-time role**: Embedded Software Engineer at EnseraDesign  
**Personal projects**: Developing wearable, assistive, and robotic systems as exploratory and research-driven prototypes  
Check out my [repositories](https://github.com/shabaj-ahmed?tab=repositories) to see what I'm working on.

## Professional Highlights
**PhD in Human Robot Interaction (University of Bristol)**  
Conducted research on robotic coaches for long-term behaviour change. My [thesis](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/15386149) centred on the design and evaluation of a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) designed to support the formation of sustainable habits in health and fitness contexts.

**Co-founder at 3D Farms**  
Led the development of an automated aeroponics system for controlled indoor environment agriculture.

**ADAS System Architect at Jaguar Land Rover**  
Coordinated autonomous driving data flows and interfaces across multiple ECUs.

## Education
**CDT in Robotics** – University of Bristol  
**MEng in Mechanical Engineering (First Class Honours)** – Cardiff University  

## Key Projects and Achievements
**Habit Formation SAR**  
A SAR system designed to support long-term behaviour change. This work formed the core of my PhD research, exploring how robotic systems can help users adopt and sustain healthy routines.

**Progressable**  
A cross-platform exercise journal application developed in Flutter. The app is no longer actively maintained, but the project remains available as an example of my cross-platform development work.

## Hobbies and Interests
Outside of engineering, I maintain a balanced lifestyle with interests in fitness, photography, and hands-on DIY projects.

## Looking for Collaborations
I am interested in collaborating on projects that focus on assistive technology, health and fitness tools, wearables, or robotics that support human capability and wellbeing.  
If you are developing an idea in this space or need a custom assistive tool for personal use, please feel free to get in touch.
