### Hi, I'm Shabaj

**About Me** <br />
I am an Embedded Software Engineer at EnseraDesign. My experience spans mechanical design, embedded systems, electronics, and software development. I enjoy building technology that supports people in practical and meaningful ways, especially in the health, well-being, and assistive technology space.

**Skills and Expertise** <br />
**Embedded & Robotics Engineering**: ESP32/STM32, FreeRTOS, BLE, sensor integration <br />
**Software Development**: Python, C/C++, Flutter (Dart), robotics prototyping with ROS2 <br />
**Systems Thinking**: Multidisciplinary prototyping, systems engineering, systems architecture, UX for human-robot interaction <br />
**Collaborative R&D**: Experience working across engineering, research, and product teams <br />
**Mechanical & Electronics Foundations**: Mechanical design, prototyping, PCB basics, system integration <br />

**Current Work and Skills** <br />
**Full-time role**: Embedded Software Engineer at EnseraDesign <br />
**Personal projects**: Developing wearable, assistive, and robotic systems as exploratory and research-driven prototypes <br />
Check out my [repositories](https://github.com/shabaj-ahmed?tab=repositories) to see what I'm working on.

**Professional Highlights** <br />
**PhD in Human–Robot Interaction (University of Bristol)** <br />
Conducted research on robotic coaches for long-term behaviour change. My [thesis](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/15386149) centred on the design and evaluation of a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) designed to support the formation of sustainable habits in health and fitness contexts. <br /><br />
**Co-founder at 3D Farms** <br />
Led the development of an automated aeroponics system for controlled indoor environment agriculture. <br /><br />
**ADAS System Architect at Jaguar Land Rover** <br />
Coordinated autonomous driving data flows and interfaces across multiple ECUs. <br />

**Education** <br />
**CDT in Robotics** - Bristol University <br />
**MEng in Mechanical Engineering (First Class Honours)** - Cardiff University <br />

**Key Projects and Achievements** <br />
**Habit Formation SAR**: A SAR system designed to support long-term behaviour change. This work formed the core of my PhD research, exploring how robotic systems can help users adopt and sustain healthy routines.  <br /><br />
**Progressable**: A cross-platform exercise journal application developed in Flutter. The app is no longer actively maintained, but the project remains available as an example of my cross-platform development work. <br />

**Hobbies and Interests** <br />
Outside of engineering, I maintain a balanced lifestyle with interests in fitness, photography, and hands-on DIY projects. <br />

**Looking for Collaborations** <br />
I am interested in collaborating on projects that focus on assistive technology, health and fitness tools, wearables, or robotics that support human capability and wellbeing. <br />
If you are developing an idea in this space or need a custom assistive tool for personal use, please don't hesitate to get in touch. <br />
